## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Anaconda

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of normal and infected ears. Images were preprocessed using normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques.

---

## 📊 Model Overview

- Model: ResNet50 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
- Input Shape: (224 x 224 x 3)
- Output: Binary classification – Infected / Normal
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

---

## 📷 Sample Workflow

1. Upload ear image
2. Preprocess image (resize, normalize)
3. Pass image through ResNet50 model
4. Display prediction result (Normal or Infected)

---

## 🧪 Results

- Accuracy: ~95% on test dataset
- Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report

---
